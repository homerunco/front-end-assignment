### Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is for the developer to exhibit his familiarity with front-end technologies, programming patterns and to provide a sample of what clean and reusable code means.

### Requirements
Use Vue and CSS-Modules

### Assignment

Your goal is to create an application that uses the [OpenTrivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Feel free to configure the parameters however you want.

The app should adhere to the following requirements:

- The app should have at least three views: a starting view, the question view and a summary / high-score view
- I should be able to select a difficulty when starting a new quiz. The app should have at least three difficulty levels
- I want to be able to enter my name so I can participate in the high-scores
- While participating in a quiz, I should be able to see how many questions are left and which question I’m currently answering
- Every time I start a new quiz, I should get new random questions
- When a quiz ends, I want to see how I ranked compared to other attempts in the summary view
- Each question in the quiz should have a time-limit. Optionally, this time limit should be configurable per difficulty level (e.g: on easier levels I get more time per answer). I should be able to see a countdown in the question view.
- Questions should be a mix of true/false and multiple choice

### Others
- Unit testing the application would be nice, but not mandatory.
- At Homerun, we value good design. Of course we’re looking for a developer and not a designer - but we do value a keen eye for design. So bonus points if you can not only make it look pretty but also user friendly
- If you’re feeling particularly ambitious, try to make the app work for 2 people - where each person alternating answers a question
- Feel free to add your own twist to the game - but make sure that you satisfy the requirements written above


Feel free to arrange the scaffolding of the application the way you want: the current one is the default template from `vue-cli`
